**Novel questions data can answer:**

1.  How does sleep quality impact my calorie expenditure and/or my metabolism?

2.  Does the use of emojis on a social media post correlate with higher engagement (*likes, shares, comments, etc.*)? If so, is this consistent across different demographics and industries?

3.  Are there recurring trends in literature genre popularity based on major historical events?

4.  How do music listening habits and genre popularity relate to current weather conditions?

5.  By looking at geotags and locations of social media posts, can we predict upcoming tourist destinations/hot spots?
